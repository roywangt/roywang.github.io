      <description>Sometimes, you do need a number of worksheets with common formatting and data. For example, if you work with quarterly budgets, you might want to create a workbook with sheets that contain the same column headings, row headings, and formulas. There is a way to do this: by creating one sheet and then copying it.
Aspose.Cells supports copying and moving worksheets within or between workbooks. A worksheet, complete with data, formatting, tables, matrices, charts, images and other objects, are copied with the highest degree of precision.</description>

      <description>According to the definition, a page break is a place in a flow of text where one page ends and the next begins. Microsoft Excel lets users add page breaks into any selected cell of a worksheet.
The location of the cell where the page break is added, the page is ended and all rest of the data after the page break is printed on the next page while printing. In simple words, page breaks divide your worksheet into multiple pages according to your specifications.</description>
