      <description>SharePoint by default does not grant full permissions to manage personal sites to portal administrators. That is why activation and deactivation on a personal site collection might fail when it is performed by portal administrators. This includes activation and deactivation during setup.
Granting Permission to Personal Sites
When this issue occurs during installation, an UnauthorizedAccessException at Microsoft.SharePoint.SPFeature.Activate() is logged to the SharePoint trace log. When deactivation fails as a part of un-installation, an UnauthorizedAccessException is displayed on the last setup screen for the failed deactivation(s).</description>

      <description>To uninstall Aspose.Cells for SharePoint, run the setup program. If Aspose.Cells for SharePoint is already installed, the setup program suggests removing or repairing it.
Uninstallation
During removal, the setup program deactivates Aspose.Cells for SharePoint for all site collections and retracts the solution from the server farm.
**Uninstalling Aspose.Cells **
Please note that running the Repair option does not re-activate Aspose.Cells for SharePoint on site collections. Instead, the feature must be activated manually after re-deployment with the Repair option.</description>
