Aspose.Cells for .NET also does not rely on the Office Interop libraries for any of its features so it is completely independent and robust set of APIs.

      <description>Generally, all Aspose .NET components require Full Trust permissions set. The reason is that Aspose for .NET components need to access registry settings, system files other than virtual directory for certain operations like parsing fonts etc. Moreover, Aspose for .NET components (including Aspose.Cells for .NET) are based on core .NET system classes that also require Full Trust permissions set in many cases.
