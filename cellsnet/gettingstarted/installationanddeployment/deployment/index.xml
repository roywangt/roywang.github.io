      <description>Aspose.Cells is a pure .NET component that can simplify your deployment process by using XCOPY deployment. To install Aspose.Cells, you can simply copy the component assembly (Aspose.Cells.dll) into a directory for your application: the application can start using it right away. This is possible because of the self-describing nature of .NET components. This type of deployment has also zero-impact on the installation process.
Deployment
Aspose.Cells supports both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</description>
