      <description>Aspose.Cells is created to help developers to create and manage Microsoft Excel spreadsheets programmatically. Aspose.Cells doesn&amp;rsquo;t only understand spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel Sheet Format (XLS/XLSX) but also many other file formats like Comma Separated Values (CSV), Tab Delimited/TSV (Text), SpreadsheetML etc.
Aspose.Cells provides most of the features available in Microsoft Excel but the exciting thing is that Aspose.Cells can process Excel files dynamically, which enables developers to process thousands or millions of spreadsheets very quickly.</description>

      <description>You can easily download an Aspose.Cells evaluation from the download page @ NuGet repos. The evaluation download is the same as the download for the full version: the evaluation becomes licensed when you apply a license.
The evaluation version of Aspose.Cells (that is, Aspose.Cells without a license applied) provides most of the product functionality. One limitation is that it always injects an extra worksheet with an evaluation watermark when a spreadsheet is opened or saved.</description>
