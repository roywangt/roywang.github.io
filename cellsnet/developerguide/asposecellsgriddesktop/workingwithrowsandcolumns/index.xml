      <description>In this topic, we will describe the basic feature of adding and inserting columns to the worksheets at runtime using the API of Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop. The basic difference between addition and insertion is that in addition, column is added at the end of the columns collection of the worksheet where as in insertion, column can be added to any specified position in the worksheet.

      <description>This is a basic topic for the developers that just describes the simplest approach to remove a column from the worksheet. It looks simple but a handy feature that can be used by developers in their routine tasks while working with Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop.

      <description>Similar to one of our previous topics, this topic describes the feature of adding and inserting rows to the worksheets at runtime using the API of Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop. The basic difference between addition and insertion is that in addition, a row is added at the end of the rows collection of the worksheet where as in insertion, a row can be added to any specified position in the worksheet.

      <description>In this topic, we will discuss about changing the font and font color of rows and columns of a worksheet. This is a basic level of formatting feature offered by Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop that empowers developers to customize the view of their worksheets for making them more presentable.

      <description>This topic discusses setting the column width and row height using the Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop API. Sometimes, worksheet cells contain values that are wider than the original cell. It makes it difficult for users to read the cell content. Some users don&amp;rsquo;t like to use the right arrow key to view the complete value in a cell. To solve such problems, developers can change the column width. Changing the row height solves similar issues.</description>

      <description>This topic deals with the information about freezing and unfreezing rows and columns of a worksheet. Freezing columns or rows enables users to keep the column headings or row titles visible while they are scrolling to other parts of the worksheet. This feature is very helpful for scrolling through the worksheets that contain huge volumes of data. Because, in such cases, when users will scroll data then only data will be scrolled down and headings would stay there to increase the readability of data.</description>

      <description>In one of our previous topics, we have discussed about validations but that was in the context of Validations in Worksheets (for having general information about validation and validation modes, developers can refer to this topic). In this topic, we will explain validations with respect to columns. Using this feature, it is possible for developers to apply a validation rule on any column of the worksheet. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss it in detail.</description>

      <description>In our later discussions, we have discussed about adding and managing cell controls in worksheet. But, using those approaches, we can add cell controls to single cells one by one. What if someone would like to add cell controls to all cells of one or more columns? In such cases, to reduce the efforts of developers, Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop provides the feature of adding cell controls per column basis. It means that developers can only select a desired column and specify any cell control.</description>

      <description>This topic discusses some important concepts about managing cell controls in columns using Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop API. We will explain that how can developer access, modify and remove cell controls from the columns of their worksheets. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look into it.
